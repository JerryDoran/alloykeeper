title: PWA-1422
description: PWA-1422 is a nickel-based superalloy developed by Pratt & Whitney for use in high-temperature, high-stress environments, particularly in gas turbine engines. It is a single-crystal (SX) superalloy, optimized for extreme mechanical and thermal performance in advanced aerospace applications. PWA-1422 is a nickel-based single-crystal superalloy designed for turbine blades and vanes in gas turbines. The single-crystal structure eliminates grain boundaries, which are typically weak points for creep and fatigue failure, making it ideal for high-temperature applications.

## Properties

- The alloy is strengthened by γ' (gamma prime) precipitates and optimized for creep resistance, oxidation resistance, and thermal stability.
- Directional solidification under controlled conditions to eliminate grain boundaries.
- Vacuum investment casting for precise geometries.
- Density: ~8.7 g/cm³.
- Excellent oxidation and hot corrosion resistance due to its chromium and aluminum content.
- Superior creep and fatigue resistance due to the absence of grain boundaries.
- Due to its high strength and hardness, PWA-1422 requires specialized cutting tools and machining techniques.
- Components made from PWA-1422 are often coated with thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) or oxidation-resistant coatings to enhance durability under extreme conditions.

  **Microstructure**:

PWA-1422 features a single-crystal microstructure with:

- A γ matrix phase providing ductility.
- Coherent γ' precipitates (~60% volume fraction) providing strength.
- Carbides and minimal topologically close-packed (TCP) phases to minimize brittleness.

**Mechanical properties:**

| Property         | Value(Room Temp)               | Value @ 980 C              |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| Tensile Strength | 1,200–1,400 MPa                | 800–1,000 MPa              |
| Yield Strength   | 950–1,100 MPa                  | 700–800 MPa                |
| Elongation       | 12–20%                         | 15–25%                     |
| Creep Rupture    | 250 MPa at 1,000 hours @ 980°C | Excellent creep resistance |

**Advantages**

- Exceptional creep resistance at elevated temperatures.
- Superior fatigue resistance due to the elimination of grain boundaries.
- Excellent oxidation and hot corrosion resistance.
- High thermal stability for long service life in extreme environments.

**Limitations**

- High manufacturing costs due to the complexity of single-crystal casting.
- Limited weldability.
- Susceptibility to environmental degradation without protective coatings.
- Proprietary nature may limit availability.
