title: INCO-625
description: IN 625, also known as Inconel 625, is a nickel-chromium-based superalloy known for its high strength, outstanding corrosion resistance, and excellent fabricability. IN 625 is a solid-solution strengthened nickel-based superalloy. The alloy derives its strength from the solid solution strengthening effects of molybdenum and niobium in its nickel-chromium matrix. Developed in the 1960s, IN 625 has become a versatile alloy widely used across various industries due to its combination of high strength, excellent fabricability, and outstanding corrosion resistance. Its ability to withstand a wide range of corrosive environments has made it a go-to material for applications in challenging conditions, particularly in the aerospace, chemical processing, and marine industries.
