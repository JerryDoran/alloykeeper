title: Rene-80
description: René 80 is a precipitation-hardenable nickel-based superalloy developed by General Electric in the 1960s. It was designed to meet the demanding requirements of high-temperature applications, particularly in gas turbine engines. René 80's balanced composition and optimized microstructure make it a versatile alloy for high-temperature applications, offering a good combination of strength, creep resistance, and oxidation resistance. Its properties can be further tailored through precise control of the heat treatment process to meet specific application requirements.
