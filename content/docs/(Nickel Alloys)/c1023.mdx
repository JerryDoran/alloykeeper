## Applications

### Applications of C1023 include:

- Aero gas turbines: Widely used in the manufacture of equiaxed nozzle guide vanes and seal segments.
- High-temperature environments: Suitable for applications requiring strength and durability at elevated temperatures.

---

## Properties

- Temperature capability: Maintains strength at high temperatures, suitable for use in aero gas turbine components.
- Mechanical properties: Offers high strength due to the presence of fine gamma prime precipitates.
- Fabricability: Considered difficult to weld, repair, or machine due to its high strength.
- Heat treatment response: Can be softened through specific heat treatments to improve manufacturability.

**Microstructure:**

- Features γ' (gamma prime) ordered precipitates.
- The main strengthening phase contains Mo/Ti carbides along grain boundaries and in grain interiors.
- Large dendritic grain structure (average size 1.5 mm) providing higher creep resistance.
- Oxidation and corrosion resistance: Superior hot corrosion resistance compared to some other nozzle guide vane alloys.
- Thermal fatigue resistance: At least twice the thermal fatigue resistance of certain directionally solidified alloys.
- Fabricability: Considered difficult to weld, repair, or machine due to its high strength5.
- Heat treatment response: Can be softened through specific heat treatments to improve manufacturability5.
- Density: Approximately 8.61 g/cm³3.
- Strengthening mechanism: Presence of fine γ' Ni3(Al, Ti) precipitates formed after casting2.
- Temperature capability: Maintains properties at high temperatures, with a strengthening effect observed in the 600-750°C range
