title: CMSX-3
description: CMSX-3 is a nickel-based single crystal superalloy developed for high-temperature applications in gas turbines. CMSX-3's balanced composition and optimized microstructure make it suitable for high-temperature applications in gas turbines, offering a good combination of strength, creep resistance, and oxidation resistance. Its properties can be further tailored through precise control of the casting process and heat treatment to meet specific application requirements.
