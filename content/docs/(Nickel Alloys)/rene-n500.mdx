## Properties

- High-temperature strength: René N500 maintains its mechanical properties at elevated temperatures, making it suitable for use in the hottest sections of gas turbines.
- Creep resistance: The alloy offers good creep strength, which is crucial for long-term performance in turbine applications.
- Fatigue resistance: It demonstrates good resistance to low cycle fatigue, an important property for components subjected to repeated thermal and mechanical stresses.
- Microstructure: René N500 features a γ (gamma) matrix strengthened by γ' (gamma prime) precipitates, typical of nickel-based superalloys.
- Density: The alloy has a density of approximately 8.61 g/cm³, which is relatively low compared to some other superalloys.
- Oxidation resistance: While it offers some oxidation resistance, René N500 may be more prone to type I hot corrosion compared to certain other superalloys.
- Rhenium-free composition: Unlike some advanced superalloys, René N500 does not contain rhenium, which can help reduce material costs and supply chain concerns.
