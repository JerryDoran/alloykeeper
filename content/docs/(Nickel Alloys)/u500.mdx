title: U500
description: U500 (Udimet 500™, UNS N07500) is a nickel-based superalloy designed for high-temperature, high-stress environments, particularly in aerospace and industrial gas turbine (IGT) applications. U500’s combination of high-temperature strength and corrosion resistance makes it indispensable in advanced turbine systems, though its high cobalt content increases cost compared to alternatives like IN718.
