title: Inconel HX (Alloy HX)
description: Inconel HX, also known as Alloy HX or Hastelloy X (UNS N06002), is a high-performance nickel-chromium-iron-molybdenum superalloy designed for exceptional high-temperature strength and oxidation resistance. Inconel HX's combination of high-temperature strength, oxidation resistance, and fabricability makes it a valuable material for use in demanding industrial environments where conventional alloys may fail prematurely.
