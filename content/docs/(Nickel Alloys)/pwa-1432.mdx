title: PWA-1432
description: PWA-1432 is a rhenium-free single-crystal nickel-based superalloy developed by Pratt & Whitney. It is optimized for high-temperature performance in gas turbines while avoiding the issues associated with rhenium. The alloy achieves excellent creep resistance, oxidation resistance, and thermal stability through careful balancing of other alloying elements. PWA-1432 was specifically designed without rhenium to address certain challenges associated with rhenium-containing alloys, such as cost, density, and the formation of detrimental topologically close-packed (TCP) phases during prolonged high-temperature exposure. PWA-1432 demonstrates that exceptional high-temperature performance can be achieved without relying on rhenium by optimizing other alloying elements like tungsten, tantalum, and hafnium. Its rhenium-free design makes it a cost-effective and reliable choice for gas turbine components subjected to extreme thermal and mechanical stresses while avoiding the challenges associated with rhenium-based superalloys like cost and phase instability.

**Advantages**

- Cost Savings:
  - Rhenium is one of the most expensive alloying elements; its exclusion reduces material costs significantly.

Reduced Density:

- Removing rhenium decreases the alloy's density, improving the weight-to-strength ratio for aerospace applications.

Improved Phase Stability:

- Avoids the formation of TCP phases that can occur in rhenium-containing alloys during long-term exposure to high temperatures.

Sustainability:

- Reduces dependence on limited rhenium resources.
