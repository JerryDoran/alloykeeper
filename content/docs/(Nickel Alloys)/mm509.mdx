title: Mar-M 509
description: MAR-M 509 is a cast cobalt-based superalloy developed for high-temperature applications, particularly in gas turbine engines. It belongs to the family of cobalt-chromium alloys and is known for its excellent high-temperature strength, creep resistance, and oxidation resistance. MAR-M 509's unique combination of properties makes it particularly suitable for static components in the hot sections of gas turbines, such as first-stage vanes. Its ability to maintain strength and resist oxidation at high temperatures, coupled with good castability, allows for the production of complex, high-performance components for aerospace and power generation applications.
