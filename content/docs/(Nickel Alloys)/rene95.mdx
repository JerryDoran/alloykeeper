## Properties

- Temperature capability: Maintains exceptional strength up to 1400°F (760°C).
- Mechanical properties: Offers high tensile strength (230 MPa at 23°C, 215 MPa at 650°C) and good yield strength (170 MPa at 23°C, 150 MPa at 650°C).
- Fabricability: Can be produced through powder metallurgy techniques, allowing for better control of the alloy's microstructure and properties.
- Microstructure: Features a fine-grained structure with a distribution of gamma prime (γ') precipitates, contributing to its high-temperature strength.
