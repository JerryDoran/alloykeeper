title: Rene-77
description: René 77 is a nickel-based superalloy developed for high-temperature applications, particularly in gas turbine engines. It belongs to the family of precipitation-hardened superalloys, designed to maintain strength and resist corrosion at elevated temperatures. René 77's properties make it suitable for components in the hot sections of gas turbines, where materials must withstand high temperatures, stresses, and potentially corrosive environments. Its performance can be further tailored through precise control of the casting process and subsequent heat treatments to meet specific application requirements.
