title: Rene 77
description: René 77 is a nickel-based superalloy developed for high-temperature applications, particularly in gas turbine engines. It belongs to the family of precipitation-hardened superalloys, designed to maintain strength and resist corrosion at elevated temperatures. René 77's properties make it suitable for components in the hot sections of gas turbines, where materials must withstand high temperatures, stresses, and potentially corrosive environments. Its performance can be further tailored through precise control of the casting process and subsequent heat treatments to meet specific application requirements.

## Properties

- The alloy responds well to heat treatment, which can be used to optimize the size, distribution, and morphology of γ' precipitates and carbides.
- Typical heat treatment might involve solution treatment followed by one or more aging steps.
- The high chromium content (15%) contributes to the formation of a protective Cr2O3 scale, providing good oxidation resistance.
- Shows resistance to hot corrosion, which is crucial for gas turbine applications.
- Can be cast using precision casting methods, including investment casting for complex shapes.
- Research has shown potential for microstructure modification through surface inoculation during the casting process, which can enhance mechanical properties.
- The alloy's composition is carefully balanced to provide a good combination of strength, creep resistance, and corrosion resistance.
- The high cobalt content (15%) contributes to solid solution strengthening and may improve the alloy's stability at high temperatures.

  **Microstructure:**

- The alloy consists of a γ (gamma) matrix strengthened by γ' (gamma prime) precipitates.
- After heat treatment, it exhibits a dendritic structure with carbide precipitations both at grain boundaries and within grains.
- The γ' precipitates are typically cuboidal in shape and contribute significantly to the alloy's strength.

  **Physical properties:**

- Primary strengthening comes from the γ' precipitates (Ni3(Al,Ti)), which provide obstacle hardening against dislocation movement.
- Solid solution strengthening is achieved through elements like Mo and Co in the γ matrix.
- Grain boundary strengthening is enhanced by carbide formation.
