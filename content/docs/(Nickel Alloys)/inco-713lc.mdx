title: Inco 713LC
description: Inco 713LC is a precipitation-hardened nickel-based superalloy developed for high-temperature applications, particularly in gas turbine engines. The "LC" in its name stands for "Low Carbon," indicating a reduced carbon content compared to its predecessor, Inco 713C. Inco 713LC's balanced composition and optimized microstructure make it a versatile alloy for high-temperature applications, offering a good combination of strength, creep resistance, and oxidation resistance. Its properties can be further tailored through precise control of the casting process and heat treatment to meet specific application requirements. The alloy has played a significant role in the development of gas turbine technology, enabling higher operating temperatures and improved engine efficiency. Its use in turbine blades, vanes, and integral turbine rotors has contributed to advancements in both aerospace and power generation industries.

## Properties

**High-temperature behavior:**

- Maintains strength at temperatures up to 900°C (1652°F).
- Exhibits good creep resistance at high temperatures, crucial for turbine components.
- The alloy's high melting point contributes to its stability at elevated temperatures.

**Oxidation and corrosion resistance:**

- The chromium content provides good oxidation resistance through the formation of a protective Cr2O3 scale.
- Shows resistance to hot corrosion, important for gas turbine applications.

**Casting and processing:**

- Excellent castability, allowing for the production of complex shapes and large castings.
- Can be heat treated to optimize the size and distribution of γ' precipitates.
- The low carbon content improves weldability compared to higher carbon variants.

**Thermal fatigue resistance:**

- Demonstrates good thermal fatigue resistance, crucial for components subjected to rapid temperature changes.

**Unique features:**

- The addition of Nb enhances high-temperature strength and creep resistance.
- The low carbon content improves ductility and reduces the tendency for carbide formation at grain boundaries.

**Microstructure:**

- The alloy consists of a γ (gamma) matrix strengthened primarily by γ' (gamma prime) precipitates.
- The γ' precipitates are typically cuboidal in shape and contribute significantly to the alloy's strength.
- MC carbides (rich in Ti and Nb) and M23C6 carbides (rich in Cr) are present, primarily at grain boundaries.
- The addition of Zr and B helps improve grain boundary strength.

**Physical properties:**

- Primary strengthening comes from the γ' precipitates (Ni3(Al,Ti)), which provide obstacle hardening against dislocation movement.
- Solid solution strengthening is achieved through elements like Mo and Cr in the γ matrix.
- Grain boundary strengthening is enhanced by carbides and borides.
